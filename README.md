# Habit

This is one of my hobby projects i do to practice flutter framework. The project is to 
build an app that tracks a task or exercise you practice in a frequency. It could be sports,
fitness or anything.

## That stupid thought

In olden times, as i look for apps in app store or play store, i try to find a suitable one
that could achieve my goal, like as what i look for in the app. Now, i kinda know some frameworks 
and the question became "Can i code that?". This is one of the projects from that series.

## Issues to be fixed
- Once pops back to previous page after having change in data. The value remains same
- Need to figure out how stopwatch works
- Fix UI stuff (Maybe need some help there)
